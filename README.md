# FOOD_SCROLL
I have developed a project named FOOD_SCROLL using Python Web Application Framework - DJANGO. This app allows the user to add any sort of food item after successful login and registration process. Image, Price, Description and Name of the user who adds the item is displayed on the home page. Only authencated users can add items to the app.
